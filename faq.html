          <strong>WHAT IS AFFILIATE MARKETING?</strong> <br /> Affiliate marketing is, first and foremost, about relationships. It relies on a relationship between a merchant (ie. Retailer) and you, the affiliate/publisher, as well as a relationship between you and consumers.  When you promote the merchant’s product or service offerings (on your blog, website, social media feed, etc.) and a consumer purchases a product/service from the brand based on your promotion, the merchant pays you a revenue share of the sale that you helped generate. Compensation can include join incentives; special discounts or one-time offers to help you become more familiar with the merchant’s brand; product giveaways; blog post bonuses; and, of course, commissions. <br /><br />

          <strong>WHO ARE AFFILIATES?</strong> <br /> Affiliates can be individual bloggers, publishers and influencers as well as companies. Examples include:
            <ul>
              <li>Content/blogging sites</li>
              <li>Coupon sites (i.e. RetailMeNot)</li>
              <li>Deal sites (i.e. Slickdeals)</li>
              <li>Loyalty/reward sites (i.e. Ebates)</li>
              <li>Influencer networks</li>
            </ul><br />

            <strong> WHAT IS A COMMISSION RATE?</strong><br />
            Typically, commission rates are based on a percentage of the total sale (e.g. 10%), and in some cases it can also be a flat fee for a transaction. Your commission rate is set by the merchant.
